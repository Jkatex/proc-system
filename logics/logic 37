# 🔷 LOGIC 37 – Progressive Trust Expansion Logic

This logic ensures that **new users (SMEs, individual professionals, or new organizations) can enter the procurement platform with limited initial access** and gradually unlock higher-value or more sensitive opportunities as they demonstrate trustworthiness, performance, and compliance.

It balances **onboarding ease** with **system integrity**, enabling broad participation while reducing risk.

---

# 1️⃣ CORE OBJECTIVE

Logic 37 addresses:

> “How can we enable first-time or low-reputation participants to join the marketplace without compromising trust or security?”

Mechanism:

```
New User → Limited Access → Performance Monitoring → Trust Accrual → Higher-Value Access
```

* Reduces friction for entry
* Encourages responsible engagement
* Protects buyers from unverified or low-performing suppliers

---

# 2️⃣ TRUST LEVEL FRAMEWORK

Users progress through **graduated trust tiers**:

| Tier   | Access Level                   | Requirements                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 0 | Signup / Browsing              | Verified identity, minimal documentation                  |
| Tier 1 | Small tenders / pilot projects | Initial compliance checks, limited bid size               |
| Tier 2 | Standard tenders               | Demonstrated successful submissions, positive performance |
| Tier 3 | High-value / sensitive tenders | High trust score, no disputes, verified references        |
| Tier 4 | Premium / strategic contracts  | Proven excellence over time, high institutional trust     |

---

# 3️⃣ PERFORMANCE & COMPLIANCE METRICS

Trust expansion relies on:

* Bid submission reliability (Logic 6)
* Contract fulfillment quality (Logic 15)
* Timely invoicing & documentation (Logic 19)
* Dispute resolution adherence (Logic 20)
* Risk-aware behavior (Logic 27)

Users must meet thresholds to progress to the next tier.

---

# 4️⃣ ONBOARDING AND LOW-RISK ENTRY

* Initial tenders are **small, low-risk, or sample-based** (Logic 17)
* Provides hands-on learning without exposing buyers to high-risk suppliers
* Encourages early positive experiences that **build reputation quickly**

---

# 5️⃣ INCENTIVE MECHANISM

* Unlocking higher-value opportunities motivates compliance and performance
* Successful completion of early assignments feeds into **trust scoring (Logic 25)**
* Progressive visibility increases supplier engagement and retention
