Below is the **complete control architecture and operational design** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 17 – Sample-Based Procurement Management Logic

This logic governs procurements where **physical or digital samples must be evaluated before final award**.

It prevents:

* Informal sample handling
* Undocumented quality comparison
* Sample substitution after evaluation
* Bias in physical inspection
* Loss or tampering of submitted materials

It transforms sample evaluation into a **structured, auditable, and legally defensible process**.

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF LOGIC 17

This logic ensures:

* Samples are requested transparently
* Submission timelines are enforced
* Samples are traceable and verifiable
* Evaluation is objective and documented
* Award decisions reflect tested quality
* No post-evaluation substitution occurs

---

# 2️⃣ WHEN THIS LOGIC APPLIES

Used for procurements such as:

* Manufacturing goods
* Textiles, uniforms
* Construction materials
* Medical supplies
* Food products
* Equipment prototypes
* Software demos
* Creative design submissions

It integrates with:

* Logic 6 (Bid Submission)
* Logic 7 (Controlled Disclosure)
* Logic 8 (Evaluation)
* Logic 14 (Audit Trail)
* Logic 15 (Performance Memory)

---

# 3️⃣ SAMPLE REQUIREMENT DEFINITION (LOGIC 3 INTEGRATION)

During procurement structuring, system defines:

* Sample type (physical / digital)
* Quantity required
* Technical specifications
* Testing standards
* Submission deadline
* Return or disposal policy
* Confidentiality conditions

These rules are locked before tender publication.

---

# 4️⃣ SAMPLE SUBMISSION FLOW

```
Tender Published
        ↓
Supplier Submits Bid
        ↓
Sample Submission Required
        ↓
Sample Registered in System
        ↓
Receipt Confirmation Generated
        ↓
Sample Stored Securely
        ↓
Evaluation Scheduled
```

---

# 5️⃣ SAMPLE REGISTRATION & TRACKING

Each sample receives:

* Unique Sample ID
* Linked Bid ID
* Supplier identity
* Date & time received
* Receiving officer identity
* Storage location
* Condition status upon receipt

Chain-of-custody maintained.

---

# 6️⃣ PHYSICAL SAMPLE HANDLING CONTROLS

To prevent tampering:

* Sealed packaging verification
* Tamper-evident labeling
* Secure storage room
* Controlled access logging
* Storage environment controls (if perishable)
* CCTV monitoring (optional)

All access logged under Logic 14.

---

# 7️⃣ DIGITAL SAMPLE MANAGEMENT

For digital submissions (e.g., software demo, designs):

* File hash generated upon upload
* Virus/malware scanning
* Format validation
* Version locking
* Access permission control
* Secure sandbox environment for testing

Prevents post-deadline modification.

---

# 8️⃣ SAMPLE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

Evaluation criteria defined before submission deadline.

Examples:

| Criterion         | Example                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Material quality  | Lab test results         |
| Durability        | Stress testing           |
| Functionality     | Performance benchmark    |
| Compliance        | Regulatory certification |
| Aesthetic quality | Design assessment        |
| Usability         | User testing             |

Each criterion weighted and scored.

---

# 9️⃣ BLIND SAMPLE EVALUATION OPTION

To prevent bias:

System may:

* Anonymize supplier identity
* Label samples by coded ID
* Reveal supplier name only after scoring

Enhances fairness and objectivity.

---

# 🔟 TESTING & VERIFICATION PROCESS

Sample testing may include:

* Internal lab testing
* Third-party laboratory certification
* On-site demonstration
* Field trial
* User acceptance testing (UAT)

Test results recorded digitally and linked to sample ID.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ SAMPLE SCORING INTEGRATION

Sample score integrated into:

```
Final Evaluation Score =
Technical Score
+ Financial Score
+ Sample Quality Score
```

Or used as:

* Pass/fail threshold
* Pre-qualification filter

Cannot modify weighting after submission deadline.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ SAMPLE REJECTION RULES

System flags rejection if:

* Sample not submitted
* Sample submitted late
* Sample non-compliant with specifications
* Tampering detected
* Sample differs materially from technical proposal

All rejections require documented justification.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ SAMPLE SUBSTITUTION PREVENTION

After evaluation:

* Winning sample fingerprint recorded
* Technical parameters documented
* If contract awarded, delivered goods must match evaluated sample

System enforces:

```
Delivered Product ≠ Approved Sample → Non-Compliance Alert
```

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ SAMPLE RETURN / DISPOSAL LOGIC

Policy options:

* Return to supplier
* Retain for record
* Destroy after evaluation
* Keep as reference sample

All actions logged.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ DISPUTE HANDLING

Supplier can:

* Request evaluation report
* Challenge scoring
* Request re-testing (if allowed)

System records:

* Complaint submission
* Evidence attached
* Review committee decision
* Final outcome

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core tables:

* Sample_Registry
* Sample_Custody_Log
* Sample_Test_Result
* Sample_Evaluation_Score
* Digital_File_Hash_Record
* Sample_Disposition_Record
* Sample_Dispute_Record

Relationship:

```
Bid
   ↓
Sample
   ↓
Test Result
   ↓
Evaluation Score
   ↓
Award Impact
```

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ SECURITY & GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

* No unregistered sample allowed
* No informal evaluation allowed
* Mandatory multi-reviewer scoring (if high value)
* Locked criteria before submission deadline
* Tamper detection mechanism
* Access logs immutable

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ RISK MITIGATION OUTCOMES

Logic 17 prevents:

* Informal “preferred” samples
* Hidden sample replacement
* Quality downgrade post-award
* Biased physical inspections
* Unrecorded testing
* Supplier favoritism

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS TO AVOID

❌ No sample ID tracking
❌ No chain-of-custody record
❌ Evaluators know supplier identity prematurely
❌ No documentation of test method
❌ Sample scoring done offline
❌ No linkage to contract enforcement

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ STRATEGIC IMPACT

Logic 17:

* Strengthens quality assurance
* Increases fairness in product-based procurement
* Protects against post-award quality substitution
* Enhances trust in evaluation outcomes
* Reduces technical failure risk
* Aligns procurement with operational standards

---

# 2️⃣1️⃣ RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LOGICS

* Logic 3 → Defines sample requirement
* Logic 6 → Links sample to bid
* Logic 7 → Controls disclosure timing
* Logic 8 → Integrates sample score
* Logic 14 → Logs custody & evaluation
* Logic 15 → Records supplier quality performance

Logic 17 ensures procurement decisions reflect **verified quality, not just claims**.
