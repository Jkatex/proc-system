Below is the **complete system-level definition and flow design** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 6 – Bid Submission & Validation Logic

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF THIS LOGIC

This logic ensures that:

* Bids are submitted in a structured format
* Mandatory requirements are met before acceptance
* Deadlines are strictly enforced
* Bids remain confidential until official opening
* No bid is altered after submission
* Evaluation integrity is preserved

If this logic fails → fairness collapses, disputes rise, and legal defensibility is lost.

---

# 2️⃣ HIGH-LEVEL BID SUBMISSION FLOW

```
Supplier Views Tender (Logic 4)
        ↓
Eligibility Check
        ↓
Bid Draft Creation
        ↓
Structured Data Entry
        ↓
Mandatory Validation Engine
        ↓
Compliance Validation
        ↓
Final Submission Confirmation
        ↓
Bid Encryption & Timestamping
        ↓
Submission Receipt Issued
        ↓
Bid Locked Until Opening
```

---

# 3️⃣ BID ELIGIBILITY CHECK

Before supplier can start a bid:

System validates:

* Supplier trust level ≥ required level (Logic 1)
* Supplier not suspended
* Supplier not conflicted
* Tender still open
* Submission deadline not passed

If any condition fails → bid creation blocked.

---

# 4️⃣ BID TYPES SUPPORTED

The system must support multiple formats:

---

## 🔹 A. Price-Only Bid

Used for:

* Commoditized goods

Structure:

* Line-item pricing
* Tax declaration
* Delivery timeline
* Confirmation of compliance

---

## 🔹 B. Two-Envelope Model (Technical + Financial)

Used for:

* Complex services
* Infrastructure
* Consulting

Structure:

Envelope 1:

* Technical proposal
* Methodology
* Experience
* Team profiles

Envelope 2:

* Financial proposal
* Pricing breakdown

System ensures:

* Financial envelope cannot be viewed until technical scoring complete.

---

## 🔹 C. Service Proposal Model

Includes:

* Work plan
* Milestones
* Resource allocation
* KPIs
* Payment schedule

---

## 🔹 D. Multi-Lot Bidding

Supplier may:

* Bid on one lot
* Bid on multiple lots
* Offer bundled pricing

System tracks lot-level submissions independently.

---

# 5️⃣ STRUCTURED DATA ENTRY ENGINE

Bids must be structured—not free-form PDFs only.

System enforces:

* Line-item pricing forms
* Mandatory compliance checkboxes
* Numeric validation (no negative prices)
* Required document uploads
* File size limits
* Accepted file formats

All required fields must be completed before submission.

---

# 6️⃣ VALIDATION ENGINE

Before submission, system runs:

---

## 🔹 A. Mandatory Field Validation

* All required documents uploaded
* All pricing fields completed
* Eligibility declarations signed
* Bid security attached (if required)

---

## 🔹 B. Logical Validation

Examples:

* Total = Sum of line items
* Currency matches tender currency
* Delivery timeline ≤ allowed maximum
* No pricing in technical envelope

---

## 🔹 C. Compliance Validation

Checks:

* Supplier certifications valid
* No sanctions flag triggered
* No duplicate bid submission
* Digital signature valid

If validation fails → submission blocked with error explanation.

---

# 7️⃣ DEADLINE ENFORCEMENT LOGIC

System must enforce:

```
If Current_Time > Submission_Deadline
Then Block Submission
```

Controls:

* Server-based timestamp (not user device)
* Timezone normalization
* Grace period policy (if defined)
* System lock at exact deadline

No manual acceptance after deadline unless:

* Official extension recorded
* Logged with justification

---

# 8️⃣ CONFIDENTIALITY & ENCRYPTION

Upon submission:

* Bid is encrypted using public key cryptography
* Separate keys for technical and financial envelopes
* Stored in secure encrypted storage
* Only accessible at official opening time

Encryption flow:

```
Supplier Submits Bid
        ↓
System Encrypts with Tender-Specific Public Key
        ↓
Stored Encrypted
        ↓
Private Key Released Only at Opening Time
```

Prevents:

* Internal tampering
* Early access
* Insider manipulation

---

# 9️⃣ BID LOCKING MECHANISM

After submission:

* Bid status = "Locked"
* Supplier cannot edit
* Supplier cannot withdraw (unless policy allows)
* Any modification requires:

  * Withdrawal before deadline
  * Resubmission before deadline

Audit log records:

* Submission time
* IP address
* Device fingerprint
* Version hash

---

# 🔟 BID WITHDRAWAL & RESUBMISSION LOGIC

If allowed:

```
Supplier Withdraws Bid
        ↓
Withdrawal Logged
        ↓
Bid Marked Withdrawn
        ↓
Supplier May Resubmit (Before Deadline)
```

After deadline:

* Withdrawal may require formal request.
* Logged and visible in audit.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ BID OPENING LOGIC

At official opening time:

```
Deadline Passed
        ↓
System Locks Submission Portal
        ↓
Authorized Opening Committee Logs In
        ↓
Multi-Person Authentication Required
        ↓
Decryption Triggered
        ↓
Opening Report Generated
```

For two-envelope model:

* Only technical proposals opened first.
* Financial proposals remain encrypted until technical scoring finalized.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ OPENING REPORT GENERATION

System auto-generates:

* List of bidders
* Submission timestamps
* Bid completeness status
* Lot participation
* Financial summary (if applicable)

Report is:

* Timestamped
* Digitally signed
* Stored immutably

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ INTEGRITY CONTROLS

To preserve fairness:

* No late bid visibility
* No editing after lock
* No internal preview before opening
* Blind evaluation support
* Version hashing of submitted files

Hash verification ensures:

* Bid not altered post-submission.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core Tables:

* Bids
* Bid_Line_Items
* Bid_Documents
* Bid_Status
* Bid_Envelope
* Bid_Validation_Log
* Bid_Withdrawal_Log
* Bid_Opening_Report
* Bid_Hash_Record

Relationship:

```
Tender
   ↓
Bids
   ↓
Technical & Financial Envelopes
```

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ SECURITY CONTROLS REQUIRED

* End-to-end encryption
* Multi-factor authentication
* Rate limiting
* Anti-bot protection
* Virus scanning on uploads
* Secure key management system
* Hardware security module (HSM) for key storage
* Immutable audit logging

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ EDGE CASE HANDLING

* Power outage at deadline
* Partial upload failures
* Corrupted document upload
* Duplicate submissions
* System outage during submission window
* Cross-border timezone disputes
* Emergency tender extensions

All require predefined policy logic.

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ KPI METRICS

* Bid rejection rate due to validation
* Average submission time before deadline
* Withdrawal frequency
* Technical disqualification rate
* Late attempt rate
* Encryption integrity error rate

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS (TO PREVENT)

* Allowing PDF-only unstructured bids
* Allowing editing after submission
* Weak encryption
* Allowing evaluation access before deadline
* Inconsistent deadline enforcement
* Manual override without audit log

System must eliminate these vulnerabilities.

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ END-TO-END SUMMARY

Logic 6 ensures:

* Structured bid submission
* Mandatory compliance validation
* Strict deadline enforcement
* Confidentiality before opening
* Immutable locking after submission
* Controlled envelope separation
* Transparent opening process

It protects the **integrity of competition** and forms the foundation for:

**Logic 7 – Evaluation & Scoring Governance**
