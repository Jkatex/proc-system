Below is the **complete system-level definition and flow design** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 4 – Tender Publication & Market Visibility Logic

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF THIS LOGIC

This logic governs:

* How tenders are published
* Who can see them
* When they become visible
* How they are distributed across the marketplace
* How fairness and equal access are ensured

It directly impacts:

* Competition levels
* Supplier participation
* Market transparency
* Anti-corruption safeguards
* Reduction of market fragmentation

---

```

---

# 3️⃣ PRE-PUBLICATION VALIDATION

Before a tender can go live, the system checks:

### A. Structural Completeness

* Evaluation criteria locked
* Budget defined
* Timeline valid
* Scope complete

### B. Governance Checks

* All approvals completed (Logic 2 RBAC enforced)
* No pending compliance flags
* No conflict-of-interest flags

### C. Fairness Validation

* Minimum response time met
* No discriminatory eligibility criteria
* Amendment rules configured

If any validation fails → publication blocked.

---

# 4️⃣ VISIBILITY MODELS

The system must support multiple visibility types:

---

## 🔹 1. Open Public Tender

* Visible to all verified suppliers
* Searchable marketplace listing
* Appears in public feed

Use case:

* High transparency procurements
* Government tenders

---

## 🔹 2. Category-Restricted Tender

Visible only to suppliers:

* Registered under specific category codes
* With matching certifications
* Meeting minimum trust level

Matching logic:

```
IF Supplier.Category = Tender.Category
AND Supplier.TrustLevel ≥ RequiredLevel
THEN Show Tender
```

---

## 🔹 3. Geographic-Restricted Tender

Visible only to suppliers:

* Operating in selected regions
* Licensed in required jurisdiction

Used for:

* Local compliance
* Regional supply requirements

---

## 🔹 4. Prequalified / Closed Tender

Visible only to:

* Pre-approved supplier list
* Framework agreement participants
* Invitation-only vendors

System ensures:

* Invitation list locked
* All invited suppliers notified simultaneously
* No late additions without audit trail

---

# 5️⃣ SUPPLIER MATCHING ENGINE

When tender is published, the system runs:

### Matching Criteria:

* Category codes
* Industry classification
* Geographic presence
* Certifications
* Financial capacity
* Trust level
* Risk score threshold

Matching produces:

* Eligible Supplier Pool
* Suggested Supplier List
* Automatic notification group

---

# 6️⃣ MARKET DISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS

Upon publication:

### A. Internal Marketplace Feed

* Appears in supplier dashboard
* Sorted by relevance

### B. Notification Engine

* Email alerts
* In-app alerts
* SMS (optional)
* API distribution (if integrated partners)

### C. Public Portal Listing (if open)

* Public search index
* SEO indexing
* RSS feed export

---

# 7️⃣ FAIRNESS & ANTI-ADVANTAGE CONTROLS

The system enforces:

### Simultaneous Visibility

* All eligible suppliers see tender at same timestamp.

### No Early Access

* Drafts cannot be previewed externally.
* Internal users cannot share secure preview links.

### Amendment Rules

If tender amended:

```
Amendment Published
        ↓
All Suppliers Notified
        ↓
Deadline Auto-Extended (if material change)
```

---

# 8️⃣ TIMING WINDOW LOGIC

Mandatory timeline enforcement:

### Minimum Bid Period Rules

Example:

| Tender Value | Minimum Response Time |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Low          | 7 days                |
| Medium       | 14 days               |
| High         | 30 days               |

System prevents:

* Artificially short deadlines
* Retroactive deadline changes
* Deadline shortening after publish

---

# 9️⃣ CLARIFICATION WINDOW MANAGEMENT

After publication:

```
Clarification Period Opens
        ↓
Suppliers Submit Questions
        ↓
Questions Logged (Anonymous View)
        ↓
Buyer Responds
        ↓
Response Visible to All Suppliers
```

Controls:

* No private answers allowed
* All Q&A logged
* Time-stamped
* Immutable

Ensures:

* No supplier receives privileged information

---

# 🔟 MARKET FRAGMENTATION REDUCTION LOGIC

To reduce fragmentation:

### Unified Categorization System

* Standard taxonomy across marketplace
* Prevents duplicate classifications

### Intelligent Recommendation Engine

* Suggests tenders to SMEs
* Suggests smaller lots for small suppliers

### Lot Structuring Option

Tender can be split into lots:

* Lot 1: Hardware
* Lot 2: Installation
* Lot 3: Maintenance

Enables:

* SME participation
* Increased competition

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ ELIGIBILITY FILTERING DURING VISIBILITY

System hides tenders from suppliers if:

* Trust level below threshold
* Sanctioned entity
* Suspended account
* Conflict-of-interest flag
* Category mismatch

But system logs:

* Why tender was not shown
* For audit purposes

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ SEARCH & DISCOVERY LOGIC

Suppliers can:

* Filter by category
* Filter by value range
* Filter by region
* Filter by deadline
* Filter by buyer organization

Search ranking factors:

* Category relevance
* Supplier past performance match
* Location proximity
* Capacity match

No ranking bias toward specific suppliers.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ AUDIT & TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS

For every publication:

Log:

* Publish timestamp
* Visibility type
* Eligible supplier count
* Notification batch ID
* Amendment history
* Deadline history

All stored in immutable audit log.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core Tables:

* Tenders
* Tender_Visibility_Rules
* Supplier_Eligibility_Match
* Tender_Notifications
* Clarification_Log
* Publication_Audit_Log
* Amendments
* Deadline_History

Relationship:

```
Tender
   ↓
Visibility Rules
   ↓
Eligible Supplier Pool
   ↓
Notifications
```

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ SECURITY & GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

* No manual override of publish time without audit log
* Two-factor authentication before high-value publication
* IP logging of publisher
* Automatic freeze if legal injunction issued
* System-wide suspension capability

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ EDGE CASE HANDLING

* Emergency procurement (shortened timeline with justification log)
* Tender cancellation (must record reason)
* Tender extension (automatic notifications)
* Partial cancellation of lots
* Re-publication after cancellation
* Cross-border tenders

All must maintain transparency history.

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ KPIs TO TRACK

* Supplier reach per tender
* Average number of bids per tender
* Time-to-bid ratio
* Amendment frequency
* Clarification response time
* SME participation rate
* Market concentration index

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ COMPLETE END-TO-END SUMMARY

Logic 4 ensures:

* Equal access to opportunities
* Transparent publication timing
* Intelligent supplier matching
* Fair clarification process
* Controlled amendments
* Reduced market fragmentation
* Increased competition

It connects:

**Structured procurement needs (Logic 3)**
with
**Active supplier participation (Logic 5 – Bidding & Submission)**
