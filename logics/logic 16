Below is the **complete operational risk architecture** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 16 – Logistics Feasibility & Delivery Risk Logic

This logic ensures procurement decisions are not made purely on price and technical merit, but also on **real-world deliverability**.

It prevents awards to suppliers who *can win on paper but fail in execution due to logistics constraints*.

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF LOGIC 16

This logic ensures:

* Delivery commitments are realistic
* Transportation capacity is verified
* Geographic constraints are evaluated
* Supply chain risks are considered
* Lead times align with operational needs

It prevents:

* Delayed project implementation
* Contract failures
* Emergency re-procurement
* Cost overruns due to logistics disruption

---

# 2️⃣ WHERE THIS LOGIC OPERATES

It integrates with:

* Logic 3 (Need Definition – delivery timelines defined)
* Logic 5 (Supplier Discovery – filter by geographic feasibility)
* Logic 8 (Evaluation – logistics as weighted criterion)
* Logic 15 (Supplier Performance – past delivery reliability)

Flow:

```
Procurement Need Defined
        ↓
Supplier Capability Review
        ↓
Logistics Risk Assessment
        ↓
Delivery Feasibility Score
        ↓
Evaluation Integration
        ↓
Award Decision Impact
```

---

## 🔹 B. Transportation Constraints

* Freight availability
* Port congestion risk
* Seasonal transport disruption
* Infrastructure limitations

---

## 🔹 C. Supplier Distribution Capacity

* Warehousing presence

* Inventory management maturity
* Backup distribution routes

---

## 🔹 D. Time Sensitivity

* Required delivery deadline
* Production lead time
* Buffer availability
* Emergency procurement context

---

# 4️⃣ DELIVERY FEASIBILITY SCORING MODEL

System generates:

```
Delivery Feasibility Score (0–100)
```

Based on weighted components:

| Component                       | Weight Example |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Geographic Risk                 | 25%            |
| Transport Capacity              | 25%            |
| Supplier Infrastructure         | 25%            |
| Lead Time Realism               | 15%            |
| Historical Delivery Reliability | 10%            |

Weights configurable per category.

---

# 5️⃣ HISTORICAL DELIVERY PERFORMANCE INTEGRATION

Pulls from Logic 15:

* On-time delivery %
* Average delay duration
* Contract termination due to delay
* Force majeure frequency

If supplier has poor delivery history → risk multiplier applied.

---

# 6️⃣ RISK CLASSIFICATION OUTPUT

System categorizes:

| Risk Level | Meaning                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Low        | Delivery feasible under normal conditions |
| Medium     | Moderate disruption risk                  |
| High       | Significant likelihood of delay           |
| Critical   | Delivery unrealistic                      |

High or Critical risk triggers:

* Escalation to approval (Logic 11)
* Mandatory mitigation plan

---

# 7️⃣ LOGISTICS ADJUSTMENT IN EVALUATION

Integration into Logic 8:

Options:

* Logistics as standalone weighted criterion
* Logistics risk as score deduction
* Logistics feasibility as pass/fail threshold

Example:

```
Final Evaluation Score =
Technical Score
+ Financial Score
+ Logistics Feasibility Score
− Risk Penalty
```

---

# 8️⃣ TRANSPORT COST NORMALIZATION

Logistics cost impacts price evaluation.

System may:

* Estimate realistic freight cost
* Adjust bid price for unrealistic freight assumptions
* Flag underpriced logistics components

Prevents artificially low bids ignoring delivery cost.

---

# 9️⃣ SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION MONITORING

System can integrate:

* Weather risk alerts
* Port congestion indicators
* Geopolitical instability flags
* Commodity transport volatility

Allows dynamic risk reassessment.

---

# 🔟 MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS

If logistics risk high:

Supplier must provide:

* Contingency plan
* Alternative routing strategy
* Inventory buffer plan
* Performance bond adjustment
* Insurance confirmation

Approval required before award.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ MULTI-LOCATION DELIVERY CONTROL

For complex procurements:

System evaluates:

* Split shipment feasibility
* Regional distribution centers
* Phased delivery schedule
* Synchronization across sites

Prevents systemic delivery bottlenecks.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ PROJECT-BASED LOGISTICS SIMULATION (ADVANCED)

System can simulate:

```
Delivery Timeline Projection
Based on:
    Production Lead Time
    Shipping Time
    Customs Clearance
    On-Site Handling
```

Outputs realistic completion estimate.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core tables:

* Logistics_Risk_Profile
* Delivery_Feasibility_Score
* Supplier_Distribution_Record
* Historical_Delivery_Performance
* Transport_Route_Map
* Risk_Alert_Log
* Mitigation_Plan_Record

Relationship:

```

# 1️⃣4️⃣ SPECIAL SCENARIOS HANDLING

---

## 🔹 Emergency Procurement

* Mandatory post-delivery review

---

## 🔹 Cross-Border Procurement

* FX volatility impact
* Import license validation

---

## 🔹 Perishable or Time-Critical Goods

* Cold chain verification

# 1️⃣5️⃣ RISK MITIGATION OUTCOMES

Logic 16 prevents:

* Awarding to geographically incapable suppliers
* Unrealistic delivery promises
* Hidden freight costs
* Port-related delays
* Incomplete project execution
* Emergency corrective procurement

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ KPI METRICS

* On-time delivery rate (system-wide)
* Average logistics delay days
* Delivery risk forecast accuracy

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS TO AVOID

❌ Ignoring delivery feasibility in evaluation
❌ Assuming all suppliers can deliver equally
❌ No geographic risk modeling
❌ No historical delivery tracking
❌ Not factoring customs or border constraints
❌ Overreliance on supplier declarations

* Bridges procurement and operations
* Reduces downstream project failure
* Enhances reliability of sourcing decisions
* Protects timelines

# 1️⃣9️⃣ RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LOGICS

* Logic 3 → Defines delivery requirements
* Logic 5 → Filters suppliers by geographic capability
* Logic 8 → Integrates logistics score
* Logic 9 → Adjusts for transport cost realism
* Logic 15 → Uses delivery performance history
* Logic 11 → Escalates high-risk awards

Logic 16 ensures procurement decisions are not just **financially sound**, but **operationally executable**.
