# 🔷 LOGIC 22 – Supplier Capacity & Saturation Awareness Logic

This logic ensures suppliers are evaluated not only on **price and quality**, but also on whether they realistically have the **capacity to execute** the contract without failure.

It addresses a critical blind spot in procurement:

> A supplier can win on paper but fail in practice due to overload.

Logic 22 introduces workload intelligence into evaluation and award decisions.

---

# 1️⃣ CORE OBJECTIVE

Logic 22 ensures:

* Suppliers are not overcommitted
* Delivery failures are reduced
* Award decisions reflect execution reality
* Capacity risk is visible before contract signing
* Buyers avoid operational disruption

It integrates operational feasibility into procurement governance.

---

# 2️⃣ THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES

Common failure scenario:

```
Supplier wins multiple contracts
        ↓
Operational overload
        ↓
Delayed delivery
        ↓
Quality degradation
        ↓
Disputes & penalties
```

Traditional procurement does not check live workload.

Logic 22 closes that gap.

---

# 3️⃣ DATA INPUTS USED

The system estimates capacity using:

* Active contracts
* Contract value
* Delivery timelines
* Open milestones
* Pending invoices
* Historical throughput
* Average delivery speed
* Workforce size (if declared)
* Production capacity (if goods-based)

---

# 4️⃣ CAPACITY ESTIMATION MODEL

Example simplified model:

```
Available Capacity =
Declared Capacity
− Active Contract Load
− Pending Commitments
```

Where:

```
Active Load =
Σ (Contract Complexity × Delivery Time × Volume Factor)
```

System may calculate:

* Utilization %
* Risk score
* Overload probability

---

# 5️⃣ CAPACITY VISIBILITY DURING EVALUATION

During bid evaluation (Logic 8), panel sees:

* Supplier Capacity Index
* Current Utilization %
* Delivery Risk Flag
* Historical On-Time Rate

Capacity becomes a scored factor.

---

# 6️⃣ SATURATION THRESHOLDS

System may define thresholds such as:

* <60% utilization → Low Risk
* 60–85% → Moderate Risk
* 85–100% → High Risk
* > 100% → Overcommitted (Flagged)

High-risk suppliers require justification if selected.

---

# 7️⃣ DIFFERENT MODELS FOR GOODS VS SERVICES

### A. Goods Suppliers

Capacity based on:

* Production volume
* Manufacturing cycles
* Warehouse capacity
* Logistics bandwidth

### B. Service Providers

Capacity based on:

* Active projects
* Team size
* Named personnel availability
* Hours committed per month

Logic 22 adapts by procurement type.

---

# 8️⃣ NAMED PERSONNEL AVAILABILITY CHECK

For professional services (Logic 18):

System checks:

* Whether proposed personnel are assigned elsewhere
* Overlapping timelines
* Hour allocation feasibility

Prevents “double-booking” experts.

---

# 9️⃣ HISTORICAL DELIVERY PERFORMANCE ADJUSTMENT

Capacity risk is weighted against:

* Past on-time completion rate
* Delay frequency
* Dispute history (Logic 20)

A supplier with high utilization but strong performance may receive lower risk score.

---

# 🔟 PREDICTIVE RISK MODEL

Advanced implementation may use:

* Throughput forecasting
* Seasonal load prediction
* Category demand trends
* Clustered contract timelines

System can simulate:

```
If awarded → Utilization becomes 112%
→ Delivery Risk Probability = 37%
```

Enables data-driven decision-making.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ MULTI-BUYER VISIBILITY (WITH LOGIC 21)

In centralized markets:

* System sees supplier commitments across multiple buyers
* Overcommitment across institutions detected
* Prevents supplier winning excessive concurrent contracts

This is a major market-stabilizing function.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ SUPPLIER SELF-DECLARATION + SYSTEM VERIFICATION

Suppliers declare:

* Maximum monthly capacity
* Workforce scale
* Production limits

System cross-checks:

* Historical throughput
* Current active contracts
* Delivery delays

Detects inflated capacity claims.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ REAL-TIME CAPACITY MONITORING

Capacity is not static.

System updates when:

* Contract completed
* Milestone delivered
* Dispute extends timeline
* Contract terminated

Risk score recalculates dynamically.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ DECISION SUPPORT OPTIONS

If high saturation detected, buyer may:

* Split award among multiple suppliers
* Extend delivery timeline
* Reduce contract volume
* Select next-ranked supplier
* Require capacity guarantee

Decision must be documented.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core entities:

* Supplier_Capacity_Profile
* Active_Contract_Record
* Utilization_Calculation_Record
* Delivery_Timeline_Map
* Capacity_Risk_Score
* Personnel_Availability_Record

Relationship:

```
Supplier
   ↓
Active Contracts
   ↓
Utilization Calculation
   ↓
Risk Score
   ↓
Evaluation Impact
```

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

Logic 22 enforces:

* Capacity assessment mandatory for high-value awards
* Risk flags cannot be hidden
* Award justification required if selecting high-risk supplier
* Historical manipulation detection
* Cross-buyer visibility (if centralized system)

Integrated with:

* Logic 8 → Evaluation scoring
* Logic 15 → Performance memory
* Logic 16 → Delivery feasibility
* Logic 21 → Market-wide awareness

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ RISK MITIGATION OUTCOMES

Prevents:

❌ Overloaded supplier collapse
❌ Chronic delivery delays
❌ Quality degradation due to overstretch
❌ Contract termination cycles
❌ Emergency re-procurement

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ STRATEGIC IMPACT

Logic 22:

* Improves reliability of procurement execution
* Stabilizes supply markets
* Encourages responsible bidding
* Discourages opportunistic overbidding
* Reduces downstream disputes (Logic 20)
* Enhances institutional credibility

It shifts procurement from:

```
Can they do it?
```

to

```
Can they do it now — at this scale — without failing?
```

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ MARKET-LEVEL EFFECT

In centralized ecosystems (Logic 21):

* Prevents systemic supplier overload
* Balances demand distribution
* Encourages new entrants
* Improves overall market resilience

---

# 🔗 SYSTEM INTEGRATION MAP

* Logic 8 → Evaluation Framework
* Logic 15 → Performance Memory
* Logic 16 → Logistics Feasibility
* Logic 18 → Service Personnel Locking
* Logic 20 → Dispute escalation risk
* Logic 21 → Market-wide workload awareness

Logic 22 ensures that procurement decisions reflect **real-world execution capacity, not just proposal strength**.
