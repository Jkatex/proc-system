Below is the **complete system-level architecture and flow definition** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 5 – Supplier Discovery & Matching Logic

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF THIS LOGIC

This logic moves the system from:

> Passive listing marketplace
> to
> Intelligent supplier discovery engine

It ensures:

* Buyers discover suppliers beyond personal networks
* SMEs gain fair visibility
* Matching is data-driven, not relationship-driven
* Procurement competition increases
* Market fragmentation decreases

This logic works **in parallel with Logic 4 (Tender Publication)** but can also function **before tender creation** during market research.

---

# 2️⃣ HIGH-LEVEL DISCOVERY FLOW

There are two primary trigger paths:

---

## 🔹 Path A – Buyer-Initiated Search

```
Buyer Enters Requirement
        ↓
System Extracts Structured Attributes
        ↓
Matching Engine Runs
        ↓
Ranked Supplier List Generated
        ↓
Buyer Can:
    - Invite to Tender
    - Add to Prequalified List
    - Start Market Consultation
```

---

## 🔹 Path B – Tender-Based Automatic Matching

```
Tender Published (Logic 4)
        ↓
Matching Engine Evaluates Supplier Pool
        ↓
Eligible Suppliers Ranked
        ↓
Targeted Notifications Sent
        ↓
Supplier Dashboard Highlighted
```

---

# 3️⃣ MATCHING INPUT DIMENSIONS

The matching engine evaluates suppliers across multiple dimensions:

---

## 🔹 1. Category Alignment

* Industry classification codes
* Product/service taxonomy
* Certification requirements
* Specialization tags

Matching rule:

```
Category Match Score = Overlap(Requirement Categories, Supplier Categories)
```

---

## 🔹 2. Capability & Capacity Fit

Evaluates:

* Production capacity
* Delivery volume history
* Technical certifications
* Equipment ownership
* Staff size
* Project complexity handled

Prevents:

* Micro supplier matched to mega infrastructure project
* Overqualified supplier ignored for niche task

---

## 🔹 3. Historical Performance Score

Uses data from past procurements:

* On-time delivery rate
* Contract completion rate
* Quality ratings
* Dispute frequency
* Buyer satisfaction scores

Performance scoring formula example:

```
Performance Score =
(Delivery Reliability × 0.4) +
(Quality Score × 0.3) +
(Contract Compliance × 0.2) +
(Low Dispute Ratio × 0.1)
```

---

## 🔹 4. Trust & Risk Score (From Logic 1)

Evaluates:

* Trust level
* Risk flags
* Compliance history
* Sanctions screening status
* Financial stability indicators

High-risk suppliers:

* Ranked lower
* Or excluded if threshold breached

---

## 🔹 5. Geographic & Logistical Feasibility

Considers:

* Supplier operating region
* Warehouse location
* Cross-border shipping capability
* Regulatory licensing region
* Delivery time feasibility

Matching logic example:

```
Logistics Score =
Distance Factor +
Shipping Capability +
Regional Compliance Fit
```

---

## 🔹 6. Financial Capacity Matching

Checks:

* Minimum turnover requirement
* Bonding capacity
* Insurance coverage
* Previous contract size handled

Prevents:

* Overexposure risk
* Financially unfit supplier match

---

## 🔹 7. ESG / Sustainability Profile (Optional Advanced Layer)

* Environmental certifications
* Diversity classification
* Carbon reporting
* Local supplier preference

Useful for:

* Government policy compliance
* Corporate ESG procurement targets

---

# 4️⃣ MATCHING ENGINE ARCHITECTURE

The engine uses weighted scoring.

### Composite Matching Score

```
Final Match Score =
(Category Fit × W1)
+ (Capability Fit × W2)
+ (Performance Score × W3)
+ (Logistics Fit × W4)
+ (Financial Capacity × W5)
+ (Risk Adjustment Factor)
```

Weights adjustable by:

* Procurement type
* Value threshold
* Industry category

---

# 5️⃣ RANKING & BIAS CONTROL

To prevent favoritism:

* Algorithm cannot prioritize specific named suppliers
* No manual rank override without audit trail
* Randomization among equally scored suppliers
* SME promotion adjustment factor (if policy enabled)

Example SME policy:

```
If SME = TRUE
AND Score within 5% of Top Score
Then boost ranking slightly
```

All adjustments logged.

---

# 6️⃣ SUPPLIER RECOMMENDATION TYPES

System outputs:

### A. Ranked List

Sorted by match score.

### B. Tiered Recommendations

| Tier   | Meaning        |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Tier 1 | Strong match   |
| Tier 2 | Good match     |
| Tier 3 | Possible match |

### C. Diversity Suggestions

Optional policy-driven inclusion suggestions.

---

# 7️⃣ PRE-TENDER MARKET EXPLORATION MODE

Before publishing a tender, buyers can:

* Run supplier market scan
* See available suppliers count
* Estimate competition level
* Adjust requirement structuring (Logic 3)

Prevents:

* Creating unrealistic or overly restrictive tenders

---

# 8️⃣ COLD START PROBLEM HANDLING

For new suppliers with no history:

System uses:

* Category alignment
* Certification verification
* Capacity declaration
* Trust level
* External validation sources (if integrated)

Prevents:

* Established suppliers dominating ranking permanently

---

# 9️⃣ CONTINUOUS LEARNING LOOP

After every procurement:

```
Contract Completed
        ↓
Performance Metrics Updated
        ↓
Supplier Score Recalculated
        ↓
Future Matching Adjusted
```

The engine improves over time.

---

# 🔟 DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core Tables:

* Suppliers
* Supplier_Categories
* Supplier_Capabilities
* Supplier_Performance
* Supplier_Logistics_Profile
* Supplier_Financial_Profile
* ESG_Profile
* Matching_Results_Log
* Match_Score_History

Relationships:

```
Supplier
   ↓
Capabilities / Performance / Risk
   ↓
Matching Engine
   ↓
Ranked Output
```

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ DISCOVERY INTERFACE FOR BUYERS

Buyer dashboard includes:

* Smart search bar (structured search)
* Filter by region, size, trust level
* Performance analytics preview
* Capacity indicator
* Risk indicator
* Invitation button

No direct access to sensitive competitor data.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ SUPPLIER SIDE VISIBILITY LOGIC

Suppliers see:

* Why they were recommended
* Matching criteria summary
* Capability gaps (optional)
* Suggested profile improvements

Encourages:

* Data completeness
* Capability development

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ FAIRNESS & GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

System prevents:

* Hidden supplier promotion
* Manual blacklisting without audit
* Manipulated match weights
* Discriminatory filtering

All matching runs logged with:

* Timestamp
* Weight configuration
* Output list
* Ranking logic version

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ EDGE CASES TO HANDLE

* Joint ventures
* Consortium bids
* Multi-lot tenders
* Cross-border regulatory conflicts
* Emergency procurement
* Rapid supplier scaling

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ KPIs TO TRACK

* New supplier discovery rate
* SME inclusion rate
* Buyer-supplier diversity index
* Match-to-bid conversion rate
* Match-to-award conversion rate
* Supplier churn rate
* Overconcentration risk score

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ RISK MITIGATION BENEFITS

This logic reduces:

* Collusion risk
* Repetitive award concentration
* Insider favoritism
* Supplier monopolization
* Relationship-driven procurement bias

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ COMPLETE END-TO-END SUMMARY

Logic 5 ensures:

* Buyers discover suppliers intelligently
* Matching is data-driven
* Historical performance influences opportunity
* Risk and capacity are evaluated
* SMEs gain fair exposure
* Competition increases
* Procurement becomes merit-based

It bridges:

**Tender Publication (Logic 4)**
with
**Bid Submission & Evaluation (Logic 6)**
