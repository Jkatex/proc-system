Below is a **complete system-level breakdown** of **Logic 1 – User Identity, Verification & Trust Establishment** in a procurement system, including flows, decision points, components, data, integrations, and governance controls.

---

# 🔷 LOGIC 1 – USER IDENTITY, VERIFICATION & TRUST ESTABLISHMENT

## 1️⃣ Purpose of This Logic

This logic defines:

* Who can participate in the procurement ecosystem
* How they are verified
* What trust level they are assigned
* What actions they are allowed to perform
* How risk and accountability are managed

It forms the foundation for:

* Legal enforceability
* Fraud prevention
* Reputation tracking
* Risk scoring
* Access control to procurement activities

---

# 🔷 A. USER TYPES IN THE SYSTEM

The system must support multiple identity categories:

### 1. Buying Organizations

* Government entities
* Corporates
* NGOs

### 2. Supplier Organizations

* Large enterprises
* SMEs
* Startups
* Registered partnerships
* Sole proprietors

### 3. Individual Professionals

* Consultants
* Freelancers
* Independent contractors

Each category follows slightly different verification rules.

# 🔷 C. DETAILED SYSTEM FLOW

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Registration Flow

### User Inputs:

* Email
* Mobile number
* Legal entity name
* Country
* Business type
* Tax ID (if applicable)

### System Actions:

* Email verification (OTP)
* SMS verification
* CAPTCHA / Bot protection
* IP logging
* Device fingerprint capture

### Output:

* Temporary account created
* Status = "Unverified"

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Identity Classification Logic

User must select identity type:

| Type               | Required Data                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Registered Company | Registration number, tax ID              |
| SME                | Business registration + size declaration |
| Sole Proprietor    | Personal ID + business registration      |
| Individual         | Government ID                            |

System stores:

* Entity structure
* Ownership declaration
* Authorized signatory details

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Document Upload & KYC

### Required Documents (based on type)

For Companies:

* Certificate of Incorporation
* Tax registration certificate
* Authorized signatory ID
* Board resolution (if needed)

For Sole Proprietors:

* Business registration
* Personal ID
* Tax ID

For Individuals:

* Government-issued ID
* Address proof

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Automated Verification Layer

### Integrations (country-specific examples)

* Business registry validation (e.g., Companies House in the UK)
* Tax authority validation
* Government ID API verification
* Sanctions list screening
* Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) screening
* Watchlist screening (e.g., UN, OFAC)
* Duplicate account detection
* Fraud pattern detection

### Automated Risk Flags:

* Mismatched registration numbers
* High-risk country
* Sanctions hit
* Suspicious IP patterns
* Repeated failed registrations

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Manual Compliance Review (if triggered)

Triggered when:

* Risk score exceeds threshold
* Document inconsistency detected
* Sanctions potential match
* High-value buyer access requested

Compliance officer can:

* Approve
* Request additional documentation
* Reject
* Escalate for legal review

---

# 🔷 D. TRUST LEVEL FRAMEWORK

The system assigns graduated trust levels:

| Level   | Description                 | Capabilities                 |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Level 0 | Registered but not verified | Cannot bid                   |
| Level 1 | Basic verified              | Can submit small bids        |
| Level 2 | Fully verified              | Can bid normally             |
| Level 3 | Premium verified            | Access to high-value tenders |
| Level 4 | Government-certified        | Full unrestricted access     |

Trust level depends on:

* Verification completeness
* Time in system
* Past performance
* Dispute history
* Financial validation
* Transaction history

---

# 🔷 E. ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)

Each entity can create internal users:

Example:

* Admin
* Procurement officer
* Finance officer
* Viewer
* Legal representative

Access matrix determines:

* Who can submit bids
* Who can sign contracts
* Who can upload documents
* Who can withdraw bids

---

# 🔷 F. RISK SCORING ENGINE

Each user gets a dynamic risk score based on:

### Static Factors:

* Country risk
* Industry risk
* Corporate structure complexity

### Behavioral Factors:

* Bid withdrawal frequency
* Abnormal pricing patterns
* Multiple accounts from same device
* Contract default history

### Transactional Factors:

* Payment disputes
* Delayed deliveries
* Performance penalties

Risk score updates continuously.

---

# 🔷 G. REPUTATION SYSTEM

After each transaction:

* Buyer rating
* Supplier rating
* Contract performance metrics
* On-time delivery score
* Dispute resolution outcome

Reputation affects:

* Trust level upgrades
* Tender eligibility
* Visibility in search results

---

# 🔷 H. LEGAL & ENFORCEABILITY LAYER

This logic must integrate with:

* Digital signature infrastructure
* Electronic contract acceptance
* Audit trails
* Timestamping
* IP logging
* Version control

Ensures:

* Legally binding agreements
* Evidence in disputes
* Traceability of all actions

---

# 🔷 I. DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Key Tables:

1. Users
2. Organizations
3. Identity Documents
4. Verification Status
5. Trust Levels
6. Risk Scores
7. Sanctions Checks
8. Roles & Permissions
9. Audit Logs
10. Reputation Metrics

Each action must create:

* Immutable audit record
* Timestamp
* Actor ID
* Device/IP record

---

# 🔷 J. SECURITY CONTROLS REQUIRED

* Multi-factor authentication
* Encrypted document storage
* Field-level encryption for IDs
* Secure API integrations
* Session monitoring
* Anomaly detection
* Data retention policy
* GDPR compliance where applicable

---

# 🔷 K. ONGOING MONITORING FLOW

Trust is not static.

Continuous checks:

* Periodic re-verification (annually)
* Business registration status refresh
* Sanctions list re-screening
* Financial health recheck
* Suspicious activity monitoring

If violation detected:

```
Risk Flag Triggered
       ↓
Trust Level Downgrade
       ↓
Temporary Suspension
       ↓
Compliance Review
       ↓
Final Decision
```

---

# 🔷 L. EDGE CASES TO HANDLE

* Merged companies
* Ownership changes
* Company liquidation
* Cross-border subsidiaries
* Shell companies
* Proxy bidding attempts
* Identity theft attempts

---

# 🔷 M. KPI & GOVERNANCE METRICS

Track:

* Verification turnaround time
* Fraud attempt rate
* Trust level upgrade rate
* Sanctions hit rate
* Dispute frequency by trust tier
* False positive rate in compliance screening

---

# 🔷 N. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS REQUIRED

1. Identity Service
2. KYC Service
3. Risk Engine
4. Compliance Module
5. Access Control Service
6. Audit & Logging System
7. Document Storage System
8. Reputation Engine
9. Notification Service

All services must be modular and API-driven.

---

# 🔷 O. COMPLETE END-TO-END SUMMARY

Logic 1 ensures:

* Only real, accountable entities can participate
* Every user has a verifiable identity
* Trust is measurable and dynamic
* Fraud risk is minimized
* Legal enforceability is guaranteed
* System integrity is protected

This logic becomes the **foundation layer** upon which all other procurement logics (tendering, bidding, contracting, payment, dispute resolution) depend.
