Below is the **complete system-level design and procedural framework** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 8 – Evaluation Framework & Scoring Logic

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF THIS LOGIC

This logic ensures that:

* Bids are evaluated using predefined criteria (from Logic 3)
* Scoring is objective and structured
* Comparisons are transparent and reproducible
* Decisions are defensible in audits or legal challenges
* Bias and arbitrary judgment are minimized

If this logic is weak → awards become vulnerable to dispute, corruption allegations, and reputational damage.

---

# 2️⃣ CORE PRINCIPLES

✔ Criteria defined and locked before publication (Logic 3)
✔ Scoring aligned with envelope model (Logic 6 & 7)
✔ Separation of duties (Logic 2 RBAC)
✔ Audit trail for every score
✔ Weighted mathematical aggregation
✔ Justification mandatory for non-automated scoring

---

# 4️⃣ CRITERIA STRUCTURE

Criteria are defined during procurement structuring (Logic 3) and cannot be changed after publication.

Example Weighted Model:

| Criterion         | Weight | Type                      |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Technical Quality | 40%    | Manual scoring            |
| Price             | 35%    | Automated formula         |
| Delivery Timeline | 10%    | Formula                   |
| Experience        | 10%    | Manual + documented proof |
| Risk Profile      | 5%     | Automated                 |

System enforces:

* Total weight = 100%
* No hidden criteria
* No post-opening modification

---

# 5️⃣ TYPES OF SCORING MECHANISMS

---

## 🔹 A. Automated Formula-Based Scoring (Objective)

Used for:

* Price comparison
* Delivery time comparison
* Quantitative metrics

Example (Lowest Price Formula):

```
Price Score = (Lowest Bid / Bid Price) × Maximum Price Points
```

Example (Delivery Time Formula):

```
Delivery Score = (Shortest Delivery / Bid Delivery) × Points
```

These are calculated automatically by system.

---

## 🔹 B. Manual Scoring (Subject-Matter Judgment)

Used for:

* Methodology quality
* Team expertise
* Innovation
* Technical compliance

Controls:

* Predefined scoring rubric
* Numeric scale (e.g., 0–10)
* Mandatory justification text
* Reference to evidence

---

## 🔹 C. Binary Compliance Checks

Used for:

* Mandatory certifications
* Legal eligibility
* Required documents

If non-compliant:

* Automatic disqualification
* Or zero score for that criterion

---

# 6️⃣ INDIVIDUAL SCORING PHASE

Each evaluator:

* Scores independently
* Cannot see others’ scores initially
* Must provide justification for non-maximum or low scores

System logs:

* Timestamp
* Score given
* Comments entered
* IP address

Prevents group bias.

---

# 7️⃣ SCORE LOCKING MECHANISM

Once evaluator submits score:

* Score becomes immutable
* Cannot be edited without formal revision workflow
* Any revision requires:

  * Justification
  * Audit log entry
  * Approval (if policy requires)

---

# 8️⃣ CONSENSUS / MODERATION PHASE

After individual scoring:

```
All Scores Submitted
        ↓
System Displays Score Spread
        ↓
Outlier Detection Triggered
        ↓
Committee Discussion
        ↓
Optional Moderated Adjustment
        ↓
Final Technical Score Locked
```

Outlier logic example:

```
If Score Deviation > 30% from Mean
Flag as Outlier
```

Moderation must:

* Record reason
* Record participants
* Be time-stamped

---

# 9️⃣ FINANCIAL SCORING PHASE

After technical phase locked:

* Financial envelopes decrypted (Logic 7)
* Price scoring formula applied automatically
* No manual override allowed (unless policy defined)

System ensures:

* Technical score cannot be changed post-financial opening.

---

# 🔟 WEIGHTED AGGREGATION ENGINE

Final score calculation:

```
Final Score =
(Technical Score × Technical Weight)
+ (Price Score × Price Weight)
+ (Other Criteria × Their Weights)
```

System produces:

* Raw score per criterion
* Weighted score
* Final aggregate score
* Ranking order

No manual re-ranking allowed without override protocol.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ RISK-ADJUSTED SCORING (Optional Advanced Layer)

System may include:

* Risk penalty factor (from Logic 1)
* Past performance adjustment
* Dispute frequency modifier

Example:

```
Adjusted Score = Final Score − Risk Penalty
```

Must be predefined before tender publication.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ DISQUALIFICATION LOGIC

Automatic triggers:

* Missing mandatory document
* Non-compliant technical requirement
* Arithmetic error beyond threshold
* Conflict of interest discovered

System logs reason and prevents further scoring.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

Evaluation interface includes:

* Side-by-side comparison
* Score breakdown by criterion
* Variance analysis
* Financial deviation analysis
* Risk indicator display

No hidden scoring fields.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ JUSTIFICATION & DEFENSIBILITY CONTROLS

For each bid:

System generates:

* Score summary
* Individual evaluator comments
* Consensus explanation
* Final ranking rationale
* Compliance confirmation

This becomes the official evaluation report.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ BIAS & MANIPULATION PREVENTION CONTROLS

System prevents:

❌ Changing weights after opening
❌ Editing scores without trace
❌ Viewing financial bids early
❌ Evaluator seeing supplier identity (if blind mode enabled)
❌ Single-person award authority

Optional blind evaluation:

* Supplier identity hidden during technical scoring.

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core Tables:

* Evaluation_Criteria
* Evaluator_Assignments
* Individual_Scores
* Score_Justifications
* Moderation_Log
* Final_Scores
* Disqualification_Log
* Evaluation_Report

Relationship:

```
Tender
   ↓
Criteria
   ↓
Bids
   ↓
Individual Scores
   ↓
Final Aggregation
```

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ SECURITY & GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

* MFA for evaluators
* Session timeout
* Score submission deadline
* Role validation (Logic 2)
* Immutable logs
* Conflict-of-interest validation before scoring

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ EDGE CASE HANDLING

* Evaluator fails to submit score
* Deadlocked scoring spread
* Tie scores
* Arithmetic anomalies
* Court-ordered re-evaluation
* Discovered compliance violation mid-evaluation

Tie-breaking rule must be predefined.

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ KPI METRICS

* Evaluation duration
* Score variance rate
* Outlier frequency
* Re-evaluation frequency
* Post-award dispute rate
* Score override frequency
* Tie occurrence rate

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS (TO DESIGN AGAINST)

* Unstructured scoring
* Weight manipulation
* Manual ranking adjustment
* Hidden criteria
* No written justification
* Financial influence on technical review

System must technically prevent these weaknesses.

---

# 2️⃣1️⃣ END-TO-END SUMMARY

Logic 8 ensures:

* Objective, structured evaluation
* Weighted and formula-driven comparison
* Mandatory justification
* Controlled moderation
* Locked technical-to-financial sequencing
* Audit-ready evaluation reports

It transforms:

**Opened bids (Logic 7)**
into
**Defensible award recommendations (Logic 9 – Award & Contract Finalization)**

---

If you'd like, next I can design:

* 🔹 Logic 9 – Award Decision & Contract Finalization
* 🔹 Full lifecycle architecture integrating Logics 1–8
* 🔹 AI-assisted scoring safeguards
* 🔹 Or regulatory compliance mapping (public procurement law alignment)
