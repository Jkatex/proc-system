Below is the **complete system-level breakdown** of:

# 🔷 LOGIC 3 – Procurement Need Definition & Structuring

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF THIS LOGIC

This logic converts:

> “We need something”
> into
> A structured, standardized, auditable procurement request

It ensures:

* Clear specifications
* Comparable bids
* Fair evaluation
* Budget control
* Reduced ambiguity
* Legal defensibility

If this logic is weak → evaluation becomes subjective, disputes increase, and procurement fails.

# 3️⃣ STAGE-BY-STAGE SYSTEM LOGIC

---

## 🔹 Stage 1: Need Identification

Initiator:

* Department user
* Project manager
* Operations head

User provides:

* Business justification
* Category (Goods / Services / Works)
* Urgency level
* Expected delivery timeline

System Actions:

* Assign unique Need ID
* Capture requesting department
* Log justification
* Create draft procurement request

---

## 🔹 Stage 2: Requirement Structuring Engine

The system converts informal text into structured data using guided forms.

### Core Structuring Categories:

| Category | Example           |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Goods    | 500 laptops       |
| Services | IT maintenance    |
| Works    | Office renovation |

Each category activates different form logic.

---

# 4️⃣ SPECIFICATION DEFINITION LOGIC

This is the most critical part.

System requires:

### A. Technical Specifications

* Functional requirements
* Performance standards
* Quality standards
* Certifications required
* Compliance standards
* Brand-neutral description (to avoid bias)

System validations:

* No brand-name bias (unless justified)
* No vague terms (e.g., “high quality” without measurable metric)
* Mandatory measurable parameters

---

### B. Scope of Work (For Services)

Must define:

* Deliverables
* Milestones
* KPIs
* Acceptance criteria
* Reporting requirements

---

### C. Bill of Quantities (BOQ)

For goods/works:

* Line item breakdown
* Quantity per item
* Unit of measurement
* Estimated unit price (optional internal field)
* Tax treatment

---

# 5️⃣ STANDARDIZATION ENGINE

To ensure comparability:

System enforces:

* Structured line items
* Defined units (e.g., pieces, hours, tons)
* Predefined category codes
* Mandatory evaluation framework template

No free-form unstructured procurement allowed.

---

# 6️⃣ BUDGET & FINANCIAL STRUCTURING

User must input:

* Total estimated budget
* Budget source (department/project)
* Funding approval reference
* Multi-year budget if applicable

System validations:

* Budget ceiling enforcement
* Currency standardization
* Exchange rate logic (if cross-border)
* Approval threshold triggers

---

# 7️⃣ TIMELINE STRUCTURING

Mandatory timeline elements:

| Element                 | Purpose          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Tender publication date | Transparency     |
| Clarification window    | Q&A period       |
| Submission deadline     | Fair competition |
| Evaluation window       | Committee period |
| Award date              | Governance       |
| Contract start date     | Execution        |

System ensures:

* Minimum response period based on procurement value
* No retroactive deadlines
* Time zone consistency
* Deadline lock automation

---

# 8️⃣ EVALUATION CRITERIA CONFIGURATION

System requires predefined scoring structure.

Options:

### A. Lowest Price Only

Used for:

* Commoditized goods

### B. Weighted Scoring Model

Example:

| Criteria          | Weight |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Technical Score   | 40%    |
| Financial Score   | 40%    |
| Experience        | 10%    |
| Delivery Timeline | 10%    |

Rules:

* Total weight must equal 100%
* No subjective criteria allowed without measurable scoring rubric
* Scoring rubric must be documented before publishing

System locks criteria once tender is published.

---

# 9️⃣ ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA LOGIC

User defines:

* Minimum years of experience
* Minimum annual turnover
* Required certifications
* Geographic eligibility
* Trust level requirement (from Logic 1)

System checks:

* Criteria not discriminatory
* Justification for high thresholds
* SME inclusion policy (if applicable)

---

# 🔟 RISK & COMPLIANCE VALIDATION

System auto-checks:

* Conflict of interest
* Budget misalignment
* Duplicate tenders
* Split procurement (to avoid threshold rules)
* Restricted industry categories
* Environmental compliance triggers

If high risk detected:

* Route to compliance review

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ INTERNAL APPROVAL WORKFLOW

Before publication:

```
Department Head Approval
        ↓
Finance Approval
        ↓
Procurement Office Approval
        ↓
Legal Review (if high value)
        ↓
Final Publish Authorization
```

RBAC (Logic 2) enforces:

* No self-approval
* Dual approval for high-value tenders
* Escalation thresholds

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ DOCUMENT STRUCTURE GENERATED

Once approved, system generates:

* Structured tender document
* Evaluation matrix
* Bill of quantities
* Legal terms template
* Instructions to bidders
* Submission format template

All auto-generated from structured inputs.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core tables:

* Procurement_Needs
* Specifications
* Line_Items
* Budget_Details
* Evaluation_Criteria
* Eligibility_Rules
* Approval_Workflow
* Risk_Assessment
* Tender_Drafts

Relationship:

```
Procurement_Need
        ↓
Structured_Requirement
        ↓
Tender_Draft
```

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ SYSTEM CONTROLS FOR FAIRNESS

To prevent manipulation:

* Criteria locked after publish
* Version control of requirements
* Change log visibility
* Public clarification log
* Amendment window with extension logic

If requirements amended:

* Deadline automatically extended

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ QUALITY CONTROL VALIDATIONS

System prevents:

❌ Vague specs
❌ Unmeasurable KPIs
❌ Hidden criteria
❌ Brand favoritism
❌ Undefined deliverables
❌ Undefined payment terms

Prompts user if:

* Criteria weights incomplete
* Missing scope details
* No acceptance criteria
* No dispute clause

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ ADVANCED STRUCTURING FEATURES

Optional advanced modules:

* AI-assisted requirement drafting
* Historical template reuse
* Market price benchmarking
* Suggested evaluation weights
* Sustainability scoring framework
* ESG requirement integration

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ KPI METRICS TO TRACK

* Time from need to publish
* Amendment frequency
* Bid comparability score
* Post-award dispute rate
* Evaluation override rate
* Spec clarity rating (supplier feedback)

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS (TO DESIGN AGAINST)

* Overly restrictive eligibility
* Ambiguous technical specs
* Unrealistic timelines
* Underestimated budget
* Incomplete scope definition
* Poor evaluation rubric

System must include preventive validation.

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ END-TO-END SUMMARY

Logic 3 ensures:

* Procurement needs are standardized
* Specifications are measurable
* Bids are comparable
* Evaluation is objective
* Budget is controlled
* Legal risk is minimized
* Governance is enforced

This logic becomes the **structural blueprint** that directly affects:

* Bid quality
* Supplier participation
* Fair competition
* Evaluation accuracy
* Contract success
