Below is the **complete system-level architecture and procedural flow** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 7 – Bid Opening & Controlled Disclosure Logic

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF THIS LOGIC

This logic ensures:

* Bids are opened only at the legally defined time
* No premature access to confidential information
* Controlled disclosure based on role and stage
* Transparent opening records
* Proper staged evaluation (technical → financial)
* Full auditability and legal defensibility

If this logic fails → risk of manipulation, bid rigging, legal challenge, and institutional mistrust.

---

# 2️⃣ CORE PRINCIPLES

### ✔ Time-locked disclosure

### ✔ Role-restricted visibility (RBAC enforced from Logic 2)

### ✔ Envelope separation (from Logic 6)

### ✔ Multi-person control for opening

### ✔ Immutable opening record

---

# 3️⃣ HIGH-LEVEL BID OPENING FLOW

```
Submission Deadline Reached
        ↓
Automatic System Lock
        ↓
Opening Authorization Trigger
        ↓
Opening Committee Authentication
        ↓
Multi-Person Control Verified
        ↓
Decryption of Allowed Envelope
        ↓
Opening Report Generated
        ↓
Controlled Disclosure Based on Stage
        ↓
Audit Log Finalized
```

---

# 4️⃣ DEADLINE-TRIGGERED LOCK LOGIC

Immediately at deadline:

* Submission portal closes automatically
* No further edits allowed
* All bids move to "Ready for Opening" status
* Timestamp captured from server clock (not user device)

No manual override without:

* Escalation protocol
* Audit trail
* Legal justification log

---

# 5️⃣ OPENING AUTHORIZATION MODEL

Opening cannot be done by a single person.

### Multi-Control Rule:

Example:

* Minimum 2 committee members required
* Both must authenticate via MFA
* Both digitally approve opening

Flow:

```
Member 1 Authenticates
        ↓
Member 2 Authenticates
        ↓
System Validates Role Authorization
        ↓
Opening Event Enabled
```

Prevents:

* Insider manipulation
* Unauthorized preview

---

# 6️⃣ ENVELOPE-BASED DISCLOSURE LOGIC

Supports:

---

## 🔹 A. Single Envelope Model

* Entire bid decrypted at opening.
* Summary visible immediately to committee.

---

## 🔹 B. Two-Envelope Model (Technical First)

Stage 1:

* Only technical proposals decrypted.
* Financial envelope remains encrypted.
* Financial data inaccessible even to admins.

Stage 2 (After technical scoring finalized):

```
Technical Evaluation Locked
        ↓
Financial Opening Authorization
        ↓
Financial Envelopes Decrypted
```

System ensures:

* Financial scores cannot influence technical evaluation.
* Technical evaluators cannot see pricing prematurely.

---

## 🔹 C. Multi-Stage / Multi-Lot Model

Each lot:

* Opened independently
* Decrypted separately
* Controlled per lot evaluation stage

---

# 7️⃣ CONTROLLED DISCLOSURE MATRIX

Different actors see different information:

| Role                        | Before Opening      | After Technical Opening | After Financial Opening  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Supplier                    | Own submission only | No change               | Award results only       |
| Evaluator                   | No access           | Technical only          | Technical + financial    |
| Finance Officer             | No access           | No access               | Financial only           |
| Auditor                     | No access           | View opening log        | Full view                |
| Public Portal (if required) | No access           | Bidder names only       | Price summary (optional) |

Visibility depends on:

* Tender type
* Regulatory framework
* Organizational policy

---

# 8️⃣ OPENING REPORT GENERATION

Upon opening, system auto-generates:

* List of bidders
* Submission timestamps
* Confirmation of deadline compliance
* Envelope status
* Digital hash verification
* Committee members present
* Opening time

Report properties:

* Digitally signed
* Timestamped
* Immutable
* Stored permanently

Optional:

* Public version (limited disclosure)
* Internal detailed version

---

# 9️⃣ HASH & INTEGRITY VERIFICATION

Before decryption:

System verifies:

```
Stored Hash = Calculated Hash
```

If mismatch detected:

* Flag integrity breach
* Freeze evaluation
* Alert compliance

Ensures:

* Bid not altered post-submission.

---

# 🔟 DISCLOSURE RULES BY PROCUREMENT TYPE

---

## 🔹 Government / Public Procurement

Often requires:

* Public announcement of bidder names
* Price disclosure after opening
* Public opening ceremony record

System must support:

* Public-facing report export
* Observer login mode
* Transparency log

---

## 🔹 Private Procurement

May restrict disclosure:

* No price visibility until award
* Confidential evaluation notes
* Internal-only opening logs

System must allow configurable disclosure policies.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ STAGED EVALUATION CONTROL

To prevent cross-contamination:

```
Technical Scoring Active
        ↓
Financial Envelope Access = Disabled
        ↓
Technical Finalization Required
        ↓
System Lock Technical Scores
        ↓
Financial Opening Enabled
```

No retroactive technical changes allowed after financial opening.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ AUDIT TRAIL REQUIREMENTS

Every action logs:

* User ID
* Role
* Timestamp
* IP address
* Action performed
* Envelope accessed
* Hash verification result

Audit logs must be:

* Immutable
* Tamper-evident
* Retained per policy

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ SECURITY CONTROLS REQUIRED

* End-to-end encryption
* Hardware Security Module (HSM) for key management
* MFA for opening committee
* IP restriction option
* Session monitoring
* Real-time anomaly detection

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ EDGE CASE HANDLING

* Committee member unavailable
* Decryption key failure
* Corrupted submission file
* Emergency legal injunction
* System crash during opening
* Cross-border legal compliance differences

Each must have predefined contingency protocols.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core Tables:

* Bid_Opening_Event
* Opening_Committee_Log
* Envelope_Status
* Disclosure_Policy
* Opening_Report
* Hash_Verification_Log
* Stage_Lock_Status

Relationship:

```
Tender
   ↓
Bids
   ↓
Opening Event
   ↓
Disclosure Rules Applied
```

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ KPI METRICS

* On-time opening rate
* Opening irregularity incidents
* Technical-to-financial stage duration
* Disclosure compliance rate
* Integrity verification failures
* Audit findings frequency

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS (TO DESIGN AGAINST)

❌ Early financial disclosure
❌ Single-person opening authority
❌ Weak encryption key storage
❌ Manual override without audit trail
❌ Lack of immutable opening report
❌ Uncontrolled visibility to unauthorized roles

System design must eliminate these risks.

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ END-TO-END SUMMARY

Logic 7 ensures:

* Procedural correctness
* Controlled, stage-based disclosure
* Transparency without manipulation
* Enforced separation between technical and financial review
* Immutable opening records
* Multi-person governance control

It creates the secure transition between:

**Bid Submission (Logic 6)**
and
**Evaluation & Scoring (Logic 8)**
