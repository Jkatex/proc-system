Below is the **complete system-level design and analytical framework** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 9 – Price Intelligence & Benchmarking Logic

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF THIS LOGIC

This logic ensures buyers evaluate **value realism**, not just lowest price.

It provides:

* Historical price comparison
* Market average benchmarking
* Regional price normalization
* Logistics-adjusted cost analysis
* Outlier detection
* Collusion and manipulation signals

It directly reduces:

* Information asymmetry
* Overpricing risk
* Abnormally low bid risk
* Budget misallocation
* Collusion patterns

---

# 2️⃣ POSITION IN PROCUREMENT LIFECYCLE

This logic operates:

* During evaluation (Logic 8)
* Before award decision
* Post-award for analytics
* During budget planning (Logic 3 feedback loop)

It does **not** override scoring automatically unless pre-configured in evaluation rules.

# 4️⃣ DATA SOURCES FOR BENCHMARKING

---

## 🔹 A. Internal Historical Data

* Past awarded contract prices
* Similar category procurements
* Same buyer past contracts
* Same supplier historical prices

Stored fields:

* Unit price
* Contract value
* Date
* Quantity
* Region
* Supplier type
* Delivery scope

---

## 🔹 B. Cross-Market Marketplace Data

* Average prices across platform
* Regional median pricing
* Volume-discount patterns
* Industry category benchmarks

---

## 🔹 C. External Market Feeds (Optional Advanced Layer)

* Commodity indices
* Fuel price indices
* FX rates
* Construction cost indices
* Inflation adjustments

---

# 5️⃣ PRICE NORMALIZATION ENGINE

Before comparison, prices must be normalized.

Normalization adjusts for:

* Currency differences
* Inflation over time
* Quantity differences
* Delivery scope variations
* Tax inclusion/exclusion
* Contract duration

Example:

```
Normalized Price =
(Contract Price − Taxes)
Adjusted for Inflation
Converted to Base Currency
Divided by Standard Unit
```

Ensures fair comparison across time and regions.

---

# 6️⃣ BENCHMARK CALCULATION METHODS

---

## 🔹 A. Mean & Median Benchmark

System calculates:

* Average price
* Median price
* Price range (min–max)
* Standard deviation

Median often preferred to avoid skew from extreme outliers.

---

## 🔹 B. Quantity-Adjusted Benchmark

Recognizes volume discount logic:

```
Expected Price =
Historical Unit Price × Quantity Adjustment Factor
```

Prevents penalizing bulk discount pricing.

---

## 🔹 C. Region-Adjusted Benchmark

Factors:

* Transport distance
* Regional wage index
* Import duties
* Logistics complexity

Example:

```
Regional Adjustment =
Base Market Price
+ Transport Cost Estimate
+ Regional Cost Index Factor
```

---

# 7️⃣ OUTLIER DETECTION LOGIC

System flags:

---

## 🔹 A. Abnormally High Price

If:

```
Bid Price > (Median + 2 × Standard Deviation)
```

Flag: Potential Overpricing

---

## 🔹 B. Abnormally Low Price

If:

```
Bid Price < (Median − 2 × Standard Deviation)
```

Flag: Potential Underbidding / Dumping

May trigger:

* Clarification request
* Financial viability review

---

## 🔹 C. Bid Clustering Pattern

If:

* Multiple bids within 1–2% range
* Price rotation patterns across tenders

Flag: Potential Collusion

---

# 8️⃣ PRICE RISK SCORING

System generates:

| Indicator                    | Description                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Price Variance %             | Deviation from benchmark            |
| Inflation Gap                | Misalignment with cost trends       |
| Historical Deviation         | Supplier deviation from past prices |
| Collusion Risk Index         | Pattern-based score                 |
| Unrealistic Margin Indicator | Based on industry norms             |

Produces:

```
Price Risk Score (0–100)
```

High score → elevated review required.

---

# 9️⃣ VALUE-BASED ANALYSIS (NOT JUST PRICE)

System may calculate:

---

## 🔹 A. Cost-Quality Ratio

```
Value Index = Technical Score / Price
```

Higher ratio = better value

---

## 🔹 B. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Includes:

* Maintenance cost
* Operating cost
* Lifecycle cost
* Disposal cost
* Warranty coverage

Used for long-term contracts.

---

## 🔹 C. Risk-Adjusted Value

```
Adjusted Value =
Final Evaluation Score − Risk Adjustment
```

Encourages realistic pricing, not lowest price bias.

---

# 🔟 PRICE INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARD

Evaluation committee sees:

* Bid price vs benchmark chart
* Deviation %
* Historical trend line
* Regional price map
* Outlier flags
* Risk score indicator
* TCO projection (if applicable)

No automatic disqualification unless policy defines threshold.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ COLLUSION DETECTION LOGIC (ADVANCED)

System analyzes:

* Repeated bidder groups
* Rotating winners
* Identical decimal pricing patterns
* Sequential bid withdrawal patterns
* Shared IP addresses (if applicable)

Flags suspicious networks for compliance review.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ BUDGET ALIGNMENT CHECK

Compares:

```
Average Bid Price vs Estimated Budget
```

Flags:

* Budget underestimated
* Budget inflated
* Systematic price inflation trend

Feeds back into Logic 3 planning stage.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ AUTOMATED ALERT TRIGGERS

If:

* Price > 30% above benchmark → Mandatory justification
* Price < 30% below benchmark → Financial viability check
* Collusion index above threshold → Compliance review
* Significant inflation mismatch → Escalation

All alerts logged.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core Tables:

* Historical_Prices
* Market_Benchmarks
* Regional_Cost_Index
* Price_Normalization_Log
* Outlier_Flags
* Price_Risk_Scores
* Collusion_Pattern_Log
* Benchmark_Calculation_Log

Relationship:

```
Bid
   ↓
Normalized Price
   ↓
Benchmark Comparison
   ↓
Risk Score
```

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ SECURITY & GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

* Benchmark methodology version control
* No manual benchmark manipulation without log
* Independent analytics engine
* Transparent formula documentation
* Audit-ready price calculation report

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ EDGE CASE HANDLING

* Unique custom product (no historical data)
* Emergency procurement
* First-time category procurement
* Cross-border currency volatility
* Commodity market shocks
* Extremely low competition (1–2 bids)

Fallback: External index-based benchmarking.

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ KPI METRICS

* Average price deviation from benchmark
* Abnormally low bid frequency
* Collusion alert frequency
* Budget estimation accuracy
* Post-award price renegotiation rate
* Cost savings vs historical average

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS (TO DESIGN AGAINST)

❌ Using simple averages without normalization
❌ Ignoring regional adjustments
❌ Allowing manual suppression of price flags
❌ Over-penalizing legitimate low-cost suppliers
❌ Not adjusting for inflation
❌ No transparency in benchmark formula

---
