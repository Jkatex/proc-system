# 🔷 LOGIC 25 – Supplier Reputation & Trust Scoring Logic

This logic generates a **dynamic, evidence-based trust score** for each supplier, built from verified performance history, compliance behavior, dispute outcomes, and execution reliability.

Unlike public “star ratings,” this system:

* Uses structured procurement data
* Is context-aware (category, value, risk level)
* Is resistant to manipulation
* Evolves over time
* Directly influences eligibility and risk assessment

It creates **long-term accountability and institutional memory**.

---

# 1️⃣ CORE OBJECTIVE

Logic 25 ensures that:

* Trust is earned through performance
* Risky suppliers are visible before award
* High-value procurements favor proven reliability
* Past behavior informs future eligibility
* Accountability compounds over time

It transforms procurement from transactional to reputation-based governance.

---

# 2️⃣ WHY SIMPLE RATINGS FAIL

Traditional ratings systems are:

* Subjective
* Easy to manipulate
* Emotion-driven
* Non-contextual
* Vulnerable to retaliation bias

Logic 25 uses **verified system data**, not informal opinions.

---

# 3️⃣ CORE TRUST COMPONENTS

Trust Score may combine:

1. Delivery Reliability
2. Quality Compliance
3. Dispute Frequency & Outcomes (Logic 20)
4. Financial Integrity (Logic 19)
5. Capacity Accuracy (Logic 22)
6. Ethical & Compliance Record
7. Anti-Collusion Risk (Logic 23)
8. Contract Completion Consistency

Each component weighted contextually.

---

# 4️⃣ CONTEXTUAL TRUST MODEL

Trust is not universal.

A supplier may have:

* High trust in low-complexity goods
* Moderate trust in high-value consulting
* Low trust in urgent delivery contracts

System calculates:

```
Trust Score (Category, Risk Level) =
Weighted Performance Factors
```

Context-sensitive scoring improves fairness.

---

# 5️⃣ SAMPLE TRUST SCORE MODEL

Example simplified structure:

```
Trust Score =

30% Delivery Performance
+ 20% Quality Compliance
+ 15% Dispute Outcome Index
+ 15% Financial Accuracy
+ 10% Capacity Reliability
+ 10% Ethical Compliance
```

Weights may vary by procurement type.

---

# 6️⃣ DELIVERY PERFORMANCE METRIC

Derived from:

* On-time completion rate
* Delay duration severity
* Milestone adherence
* Emergency intervention frequency

Late deliveries reduce reliability factor.

---

# 7️⃣ QUALITY COMPLIANCE METRIC

Derived from:

* Sample match rate (Logic 17)
* Rejection rate
* Rework frequency
* Technical compliance audit results

Repeated non-conformance lowers trust.

---

# 8️⃣ DISPUTE IMPACT ADJUSTMENT

Not all disputes reduce trust equally.

System differentiates:

* Resolved in supplier favor → minimal impact
* Shared responsibility → moderate impact
* Confirmed supplier breach → strong penalty

Encourages fair conflict resolution.

---

# 9️⃣ FINANCIAL ACCURACY & DOCUMENT INTEGRITY

Measured by:

* Duplicate invoice attempts
* Overbilling frequency
* Credit note history
* Tax compliance consistency

Links to Logic 19.

---

# 🔟 CAPACITY HONESTY FACTOR

If supplier:

* Overstates capacity
* Repeatedly overloads (Logic 22)
* Misses deadlines due to saturation

Trust declines.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ ETHICAL & COLLUSION RISK ADJUSTMENT

If Logic 23 flags:

* High collusion risk
* Repeated suspicious patterns

Trust score may be risk-adjusted downward.

Severe confirmed violations may trigger eligibility suspension.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ TIME-DECAY FUNCTION

Older issues may lose weight over time.

Example:

```
Impact Weight =
Severity × e^(-Time Factor)
```

Encourages rehabilitation and long-term improvement.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ TRUST TIERS

Suppliers may be categorized:

* Tier A – High Trust
* Tier B – Reliable
* Tier C – Moderate Risk
* Tier D – High Risk
* Tier E – Restricted

Eligibility rules may apply.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ ELIGIBILITY INFLUENCE

Trust score may influence:

* Access to high-value tenders
* Fast-track approvals
* Reduced guarantee requirements
* Shortlisted supplier lists
* Invitation-only procurements

High trust reduces friction.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ PROBATION & REHABILITATION MECHANISM

If trust drops below threshold:

* Warning status
* Conditional participation
* Performance improvement plan
* Monitoring period

System supports recovery, not permanent exclusion.

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ MARKET-WIDE TRUST (WITH LOGIC 21)

In centralized systems:

* Trust score visible across buyers
* Cross-institution reputation accumulates
* Prevents “buyer hopping” after poor performance

Builds ecosystem-level accountability.

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core entities:

* Supplier_Trust_Profile
* Performance_Record
* Dispute_Adjustment_Record
* Financial_Compliance_Record
* Capacity_Reliability_Record
* Ethics_Flag_Record
* Time_Decay_Adjustment_Record
* Trust_Tier_Record

Relationship:

```

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

Logic 25 enforces:

* Transparent scoring criteria
* No hidden punitive adjustments
* Audit logging of score changes (Logic 14)
* Supplier right to review major changes
* Protection against retaliation scoring

Trust must be data-driven and defensible.

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ RISK MITIGATION OUTCOMES

Prevents:

❌ Repeat engagement with unreliable suppliers
❌ Short-term opportunistic behavior
❌ Hidden risk accumulation
❌ Supplier cycling between buyers
❌ Arbitrary blacklist decisions

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ STRATEGIC IMPACT

Logic 25 creates:

* Long-term accountability
* Market stability
* Behavioral incentives for excellence
* Reduced dispute frequency
* Higher procurement reliability

It transforms procurement into a **reputation-weighted economic ecosystem**.

---

# 2️⃣1️⃣ SYSTEM INTEGRATION MAP

* Logic 15 → Performance memory foundation
* Logic 20 → Dispute outcomes
* Logic 22 → Capacity reliability
* Logic 23 → Anti-collusion risk
* Logic 19 → Financial integrity
* Logic 21 → Market centralization

Logic 25 ensures that **trust compounds, risk accumulates visibly, and performance matters long-term**.
