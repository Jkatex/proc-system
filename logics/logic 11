Below is the **complete governance architecture and system design** for:

# 🔷 LOGIC 11 – Approval Workflow & Authority Hierarchy Logic

This logic enforces **who can authorize which procurement actions**, under what conditions, and in what sequence.

It institutionalizes financial control, prevents unauthorized commitments, and ensures procurement actions comply with internal governance frameworks.

---

# 1️⃣ PURPOSE OF LOGIC 11

This logic ensures:

* No procurement action exceeds delegated authority
* Value thresholds are enforced automatically
* High-risk procurements receive higher scrutiny
* Separation of duties is preserved
* Approval chains are auditable and non-bypassable

It prevents:

* Rogue commitments
* Unauthorized contract signing
* Budget overrun without oversight
* Concentration of power

---

# 2️⃣ WHERE THIS LOGIC APPLIES

Approval logic governs multiple procurement stages:

| Stage                        | Approval Required? |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Procurement request creation | Yes                |
| Budget allocation            | Yes                |
| Tender publication           | Yes                |
| Evaluation outcome           | Yes                |
| Award decision               | Yes                |
| Contract signing             | Yes                |
| Contract amendment           | Yes                |
| Payment milestone release    | Yes (optional)     |

It operates across the entire lifecycle.

---

# 3️⃣ CORE DECISION VARIABLES

Approval routing is based on:

* Contract value
* Procurement category
* Risk score (from Logic 9)
* Funding source
* Strategic importance
* Emergency flag
* Supplier type (e.g., single-source)
* Amendment value vs original contract

These variables dynamically determine required approvers.

---

# 4️⃣ AUTHORITY HIERARCHY STRUCTURE

Example model:

| Level   | Authority             | Example Role                  |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Level 1 | Operational Approval  | Procurement Officer           |
| Level 2 | Departmental Approval | Department Head               |
| Level 3 | Financial Approval    | CFO                           |
| Level 4 | Executive Approval    | CEO / Executive Committee     |
| Level 5 | Governing Body        | Board / Ministerial Authority |

System enforces **role-based authority mapping**, not person-based.

---

# 5️⃣ APPROVAL FLOW TYPES

---

## 🔹 A. Sequential Approval

```
Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 → Level 4
```

Each step must approve before proceeding.

Used for:

* High-value contracts
* Strategic procurements

---

## 🔹 B. Parallel Approval

```
Level 2 (Technical)
+
Level 3 (Finance)
+
Legal Review
```

All must approve before progression.

Used for:

* Contract finalization
* Amendments

---

## 🔹 C. Conditional Approval

If:

* Risk score > threshold → add Compliance review
* Emergency flag → shorten chain
* Foreign vendor → add Legal + FX review

Dynamic routing engine applies rules automatically.

---

# 6️⃣ VALUE THRESHOLD ENGINE

Example:

| Contract Value   | Required Approval   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| <$10,000         | Procurement Officer |
| $10,000–$100,000 | Department Head     |
| $100,000–$1M     | CFO                 |
| >$1M             | Executive Committee |
| Strategic        | Board               |

Thresholds configurable per organization.

System calculates:

```
Effective Value =
Base Contract Value
+ Options
+ Extensions
+ Amendment Accumulation
```

Prevents contract splitting to bypass approval limits.

---

# 7️⃣ RISK-BASED ESCALATION LOGIC

If procurement triggers:

* High price deviation (Logic 9)
* Single bidder scenario
* Direct award / sole source
* High compliance sensitivity
* Blacklist proximity
* Budget variance

System automatically escalates approval tier.

---

# 8️⃣ DELEGATION & TEMPORARY AUTHORITY

Supports:

* Delegation during leave
* Acting authority
* Emergency override authority

All delegation:

* Time-bound
* Logged
* Non-transferable beyond policy

---

# 9️⃣ SEPARATION OF DUTIES ENFORCEMENT

System prevents same user from:

* Creating request
* Evaluating bid
* Approving award
* Signing contract

Unless explicitly allowed under small-value policy.

Prevents self-approval loops.

---

# 🔟 APPROVAL INTERFACE LOGIC

Each approver sees:

* Summary dashboard
* Value breakdown
* Risk indicators
* Evaluation summary
* Price benchmark results
* Legal notes
* Compliance flags

Approver must choose:

* Approve
* Reject
* Return for revision
* Request clarification

Mandatory justification for rejection.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ TIME-BOUND APPROVAL CONTROL

Features:

* SLA timers per approval level
* Escalation if overdue
* Auto-reminder notifications
* Auto-escalation to next authority if inactive

Prevents bottlenecks.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT MODE

If flagged emergency:

* Condensed approval chain
* Post-award ratification required
* Additional audit log layer
* Mandatory justification note

Ensures speed without eliminating accountability.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ CONTRACT AMENDMENT CONTROL

When modifying contract:

System recalculates:

```
Cumulative Contract Value =
Original Award
+ All Amendments
```

If threshold exceeded → escalate approval tier.

Prevents “incremental bypassing”.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ AUDIT TRAIL & LOGGING

Every approval records:

* User identity (Logic 1)
* Role (Logic 2)
* Timestamp
* Decision
* IP/device info
* Justification
* Document version hash

Immutable record.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ DATA MODEL STRUCTURE

Core tables:

* Approval_Routing_Rules
* Authority_Thresholds
* Approval_Workflow_Instance
* Approval_Decision_Log
* Delegation_Record
* Escalation_Log
* SLA_Timer_Log
* Amendment_Value_Tracker

Workflow linked to:

```
Procurement Action
   ↓
Approval Instance
   ↓
Decision History
```

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ GOVERNANCE CONTROLS

* No manual skipping of approval steps
* No editing approval decision after submission
* Locked routing logic once process begins
* Compliance officer override logged separately
* Real-time monitoring dashboard

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ KPI METRICS

* Average approval cycle time
* Escalation frequency
* Approval rejection rate
* Emergency procurement ratio
* Contract value vs approval tier variance
* Bottleneck analysis by role

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ RISK MITIGATION OUTCOMES

This logic prevents:

* Unauthorized commitments
* Authority abuse
* Budget overspending
* Conflict-of-interest approval
* Collusion inside approval chain
* Fraudulent amendments

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ COMMON FAILURE POINTS TO DESIGN AGAINST

❌ Static approval chain not reflecting risk
❌ Approval based on individuals instead of roles
❌ No tracking of amendment accumulation
❌ Emergency mode abused
❌ Manual override without logging
❌ Self-approval loopholes

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ STRATEGIC IMPACT

Logic 11:

* Institutionalizes procurement governance
* Distributes decision authority responsibly
* Protects executives from liability
* Strengthens financial discipline
* Increases audit readiness
* Enhances regulatory compliance

---

# 2️⃣1️⃣ RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LOGICS

* Logic 1 → Verifies identity of approvers
* Logic 2 → Defines role-based authority
* Logic 3 → Approves procurement need
* Logic 8 → Approves evaluation outcome
* Logic 9 → Uses price risk in escalation
* Logic 10 → Approves award & contract

It acts as the **control backbone of the entire procurement system**.
