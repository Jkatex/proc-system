  # ProcureX

  **A production-grade procurement platform foundation for transparent tendering, supplier trust, bid evaluation, contract awards, and auditable public-sector workflows.**

  ProcureX brings the original static procurement prototype into a full implementation workspace with a React client, TypeScript API, Prisma data model, shared contracts, local infrastructure, UI parity tooling, and an organization-aware security model.

## Preview

The production React client is built to preserve visual and workflow parity with the original `procurex-ui` prototype while gaining routing, state, localization, API adapters, tests, and guarded workspace surfaces.

## What ProcureX Is

ProcureX models a complete procurement operating environment for buyers, suppliers, evaluators, approvers, and platform administrators. It replaces scattered tender documents, manual eligibility checks, informal supplier records, disconnected evaluation spreadsheets, and fragile approval trails with one structured lifecycle.

The repository now contains two important layers:

| Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `procurement-platform/` | Canonical production implementation workspace: React client, Express backend, Prisma schema, shared contracts, local infrastructure, tests, scripts, and docs. |
| `procurex-ui/` | Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype used as the visual, wording, and workflow reference for the production client. |

The production platform is the source of truth for implementation. The static prototype remains a valuable design reference, not the deployed application architecture.

## Implementation Snapshot

| Area | Current implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Client | React 19, Vite, TypeScript, React Router, Redux Toolkit, MUI, i18next, Axios adapters, Recharts, Vitest, Testing Library. |
| Server | TypeScript Express API with module boundaries, controllers, services, repositories, validators, Prisma, Zod, Helmet, CORS, and Vitest. |
| Database | Prisma schema and migrations for identity, organizations, tenders, bids, evaluation, awards, contracts, records, communication, compliance, documents, intelligence, and integrations. |
| Local infrastructure | Docker Compose for PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, Elasticsearch 8, and MinIO object storage. |
| Shared contracts | Workspace package for account types and organization capability contracts shared by client and server. |
| UI parity | Screenshot capture and route mapping compare the original static prototype against the production React target. |
| Future expansion | `ml-service/` is reserved for future Python/FastAPI intelligence workloads such as risk, matching, benchmarking, and anomaly detection. |

Core product rules already captured by the implementation:

- Login account type is only `USER` or `ADMIN`.
- Buyer and supplier behavior is an organization capability, not a login role.
- A normal user belongs to a company through organization membership.
- A company can operate as buyer, supplier, or both.
- Evaluator, approver, auditor, and observer behavior is represented through workflow context and assignments.
- Database row-level security foundations are maintained separately from broad UI route checks.

```

The backend follows a consistent module pattern:

```text
routes.ts -> controller.ts -> service.ts -> repository.ts -> validators.ts -> types.ts
```

Registered API module boundaries include identity, organization, procurement, bidding, evaluation, award-contract, financial, compliance-admin, communication, records, intelligence, integration, and documents.

## Product Workflows

| Workflow | What ProcureX covers |
| --- | --- |
| Public discovery | Welcome, about, contact, policy pages, and guest marketplace entry points. |
| Identity and trust | Registration, OTP/email activation, sign-in, session lookup, profile update, verification draft/submission, and admin verification review. |
| Procurement | Tender creation, publication, tender details, documents, requirements, milestones, commercial items, and supplier-facing tender views. |
| Bidding | Supplier bid workspace, bid versions, bid documents, responses, receipts, and organization-scoped ownership. |
| Evaluation | Evaluation workspaces, criteria, scores, workflow assignments, stages, and award recommendation handoff. |
| Awards and contracts | Award recommendation, approval steps, contract versioning, negotiation, purchase order tracking, invoices, and post-award tracking. |
| Communication and records | Structured communication, attachments, timeline-style records, audit events, and searchable operational history. |
| Administration | Platform dashboard, user and organization review, compliance cases, global search, analytics, audit review, and verification decisions. |

## Testing And Verification

Recommended local checks:

```powershell
cd procurement-platform
npm run db:validate
npm test
npm run lint:client
npm run build
```

Database security verification:

```powershell
npm run infra:up
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed:twice
npm --workspace server run verify:rls
```

UI parity screenshots:

```powershell
npm run dev:client
npm --workspace client run ui:parity:screenshots
```

The screenshot workflow captures both:

- reference pages from `procurex-ui/index.html?page=...`
- production React target routes such as `/procurement/marketplace`, `/dashboard`, and `/admin`

Output is saved under:

```text
procurement-platform/docs/ui-parity/screenshots/
```

## Current Status And Roadmap

ProcureX is an active production foundation. It has a real monorepo shape, client and server workspaces, database schema, migrations, tests, local infrastructure, and a parity process for carrying the prototype into React. Some module endpoints are intentionally foundational while deeper production workflows continue to mature.

Near-term roadmap:

- Replace remaining mock client adapters with full backend module endpoints.
- Expand identity hardening, MFA, verification providers, and notification delivery.
- Complete document upload storage, hashing, signature, and audit workflows.
- Deepen sealed bid submission, evaluation committee, and approval controls.
- Add richer reporting, risk signals, supplier intelligence, and search indexing.
- Prepare deployment infrastructure, observability, CI/CD, backups, and production runbooks.
- Grow the future intelligence service boundary when enough platform data exists to support reliable models.
