# ProcureX Procurement Platform

Canonical development workspace for the production ProcureX platform.

The existing `../procurex-ui` folder remains the static prototype and UI/workflow reference. This monorepo contains the backend, database, shared contracts, local infrastructure, documentation, and future service folders needed to turn that prototype into a production system.

## Structure

```text
procurement-platform/
|-- client/              # UI integration placeholder; references ../procurex-ui
|-- server/              # TypeScript Express backend, Prisma, database seed
|-- ml-service/          # Future Python/FastAPI intelligence services
|-- shared/              # Shared contracts, DTOs, and enums
|-- docker/              # Docker notes and future Dockerfiles
|-- docs/                # Architecture, database, and API documentation
|-- scripts/             # Operational scripts

```

npm run db:seed:twice
npm test
```

## Local Testing Data

Registration code delivery is temporary in local development. With `IDENTITY_EMAIL_PROVIDER=dev-console` and `IDENTITY_PHONE_PROVIDER=dev-console`, the registration phone code and email activation code are shown in the UI and logged by the server. Real SMS and email delivery will replace this once those providers are fully wired.

Use these dev-only TRA/BRELA identifiers during identity verification. They are served only outside production.
