# ProcureX Server

TypeScript Express backend and Prisma database foundation for ProcureX.

## Commands

```powershell
npm run db:validate
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed:twice
npm run verify:rls
npm test
```

Run these from the monorepo root with workspace forwarding when preferred:

```powershell
npm run db:validate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed:twice
npm test
```

## Database Logic

- `AccountType` is limited to `USER` and `ADMIN`.
- Normal user behavior is scoped by `current_user_id`, `current_organization_id`, and company capabilities.
- Buyer and supplier behavior is stored as `OrganizationCapabilityName.BUYER` and `OrganizationCapabilityName.SUPPLIER`.
- Evaluator, approver, auditor, and observer behavior is represented by workflow assignments, not login roles.
- Platform admin inspection is account-type based and is blocked from changing evaluation scores by RLS.
